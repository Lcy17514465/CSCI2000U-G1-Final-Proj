## “Traditional” readme section
Please use the Pyhton Jupyter Notebook to open the file and run the code cell one by one from top to bottem.
Note : Don't run the plot code more than once, if the code is run more than once, the size of each content label will explode, if this situation happened, restart the kernel. We didn't know what's wrong with this situation and didn't find a soluiton to fix it.
