## Introduction
*We are a team of 3 who when analyzing the attributes of the applications hosted on the Google Play Store, have come to a shocking realization that your kids may not be entirely safe on an Android device. We used a dataset that contained all the data regarding 9660 applications that were obtained as of 2019, which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps?select=googleplaystore.csv. The dataset was made available to us via Creative Commons License 3.0. ， http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/.

## Discussion
When it comes to applications on the Google Play Store, there is no other category that contains more applications than that of “Family”. However, it may be that all these applications are not entirely family-friendly. We found that even though the “Family” category contains the most amount of applications, it’s amount of reviews are left looking miniature in comparison. Could it be that all the applications are being quarantined because they’re not family-friendly? Or could it be that children are the primary consumers of the content provided by the applications in the category? These tough questions will get a tough answer, but first, let’s take a step back, and ask ourselves, what the significance of the reviews are first.

We found that there was a positive correlation between reviews and installations. This implies that users who install the application, use it and like it, will leave a review. This also implies a positive-feedback loop as more reviews leads to more installations and more installations leads to more reviews. So why is this parity existing within the “Family” category?


## Conclusion

### Reflection
We conclude that developers are abusing the “Family” category as a way of getting their applications seen by the user with the biggest average screen time, the child. However, this may lead to your child seeing content you would not want them to see, as it seems that Google does not want to enforce proper categorization. However, this is all dependent on the dataset being consistent with the actualities of the real data that Google keeps hidden from public view.

This project was submitted as the final course project for CSCI 2000U “Scientific Data Analysis” during Fall 2021. The authors certify that the work in this repository is original and that all appropriate resources are rightfully cited.

## “Traditional” readme section
Please use the Pyhton Jupyter Notebook to open the file and run the code cell one by one from top to bottem.

Note : Don't run the plot code more than once, if the code is run more than once, the size of each content label will explode, if this situation happened, restart the kernel. We didn't know what's wrong with this situation and didn't find a soluiton to fix it.
